updating things via the notion api using docker as a self contained dev environment

we are currently using node and some sample code we found on the notion sdk for js

I have created the necessary dockerfiles to create the sandbox for Javascript to work in (tested python, but I couldn't get the integration to work well)

I have setup the test integration with my settings and have generataed the necessary API token
* I have this setup as a local integration plan

make sure that you set up a separate database "page" (not a page, but separated from pages)
make sure that the database is shared with your integration
